A strange alien stands near the crashed ship.  It's taller and more... regal than the others you saw on the mountain.  It's lips don't move but....
AlienCommander: (Telepathically) Who are you?
Steve: What?  You're in my head?
AlienCommander: I am.  It is what allows me to know your tongue.  
Steve: Wait a minute... all the chaos in town.  The people going crazy and the students having headaches?
AlienCommander: So I am.  It'll make the eventual takeover much easier....
Steve: Take over?  You can't invade earth!  
AlienCommander: Why ever not?  I was invited here for that very purpose after all.  
Steve:  Invited?  By who?
ProfessorIvarson: By me!
Steve: Professor?  Why?
Professor:  It was for revenge!  I lost my daughter to this city and nothing happened!  She was just a young girl… So I decided to get revenge.  I built a transmitter, one capable of reaching into the depths of space and reached out.  Soon enough I had an answer, and a way to avenge my daughter!
Steve: But professor, you can’t hold the entire planet to blame for the loss of your kid!
Professor: I don’t care!  I can’t just let the world keep turning with her gone!  And my new allies will ensure that it gets ended tonight!  
Steve: But why did you send me out here then?
Professor: I needed you to keep that meddling FBI agent busy while I got ready.  I knew your natural curiousity would draw you into conflict with him.
Steve: It won't work!  The FBI agent already knew that there were transmissions coming from the university!  He also has your papers.  He'll soon connect the dots and stop you!
Professor: By then it'll be too late.  Stand aside Steve, you can't stop me.
Steve: I can try at least!
