Steve: Hi. Did you see a man who has blond hair and wears green jacket?
May drinks the last beer in her glass. She seems a bit drunk.
May: Wooh, the beer is so great. I'm sorry, what did you say?
Steve: Did you see a man who has blond hair and wears green jacket?
May: Not really. But you can ask Dave, the boss of this bar. He is playing dice on the right table.
Steve: Okay, thank you.
