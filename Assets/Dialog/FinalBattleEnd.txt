AlienCommander: (Groans)
A trickle of red ichor begins to drip from the alien commander's nose.  He falls to the ground with a sickening slump.
Professor: You... you did it...
Professor: I - I didn't expect this.
Steve: Neither did I Professor, but you needed to be stopped.  I need you to give up now.
Professor: I... I understand.  I'm sorry Steven....
Steve: So am I, Professor.  So am I.
