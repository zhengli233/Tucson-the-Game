Michael: Thanks!  It's much easier.
Michael: ......
Michael: Okay, I'm done. Keep the calculator. You may need it in your test. Good luck!
Steve: Thanks, I'll need it if I'm going to finish my test in time to run Professor Ivarson's errand.  Can you beleive he has me running out to A Mountain on a Friday night?  What a jerk....
Michael: Hey, the guy lost his daughter earlier this year.  Give him a break.
Steve: Oh yeah.... you're right.  I suppose I should be more understanding. It was only six months ago, right?
Michael: Yeah about then.  Poor man....
Steve: Yeah, I better get going then.  Thanks again for the calculator!
Michael: Don't mention it.  Thanks for the help!
