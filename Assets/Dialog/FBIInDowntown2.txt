Man in green: Okay kid, that’s enough… stop while you're ahead.  What are you here for kid?
Steve: I’m just trying to check out something on A mountain for my professor.  I’ve saw you skulking around the university wherever you've been people started acting crazy.  What are you doing?
Man in green: Your professor?  
Steve: Professor Ivarson.
Man in green: Hmm… kid I’m FBI, I’ve been looking into these events.  
Steve: FBI?  Did I just attack a federal agent?
FBI: Don’t worry about it.  You said you worked for Professor Ivarson?  I may need to pay him a visit….  Be careful kid.  Something strange landed on A mountain….
FBI: You should turn back, kid.
Steve: I can't do that.  The professor needs my help.  
FBI: Fine... suit yourself.  But if you wont be dissuaded, take this map.  At least you won't get lost.
