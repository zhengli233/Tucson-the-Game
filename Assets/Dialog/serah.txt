Steve: Hey Sa..Sarah, how are you doing?
Sarah: Groan….  I’ve been feeling really ill lately, like I’m about to keel over….
Steve: Oh, that's terrible. Is there anything I can do to help?
Sarah: Thanks for asking, but I'm good. Don't worry. I feel much better after I had Eegee's. 
Steve: Really?  Eegee’s? 
Sarah: Yes. Do you want some? Here, take it.
Steve: Thanks! Emmm.., Sarah..
Sarah: ? 
Steve: I was wondering... I'm running an errand for the Professor, but after I get off would you like to catch a movie this evening?
Sarah: Sorry, Steve. I have my part-time job in the sports store tonight. But thank you for asking!
Steve: Oh..Okay. (Sigh..)
