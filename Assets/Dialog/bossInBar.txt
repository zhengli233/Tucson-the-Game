Steve: Are you Dave, the owner of this bar?
The man is playing dice with other customers and looks unhappy because of your interruption.
Dave: Yes, I am. If you want to order something go and ask waiters.  I'd recommend our special beer.
Steve: I don't want any beer. I'm here to find a man with blond hair and in green jacket. Did you see him?
Dave: Yes. But I will tell you only if you can win a game of chance with me.  What do you say?
Steve: That's nuts!  You won't tell me where a guy went if I don't gamble with you?
Dave: Yeah... it does... but I really NEED a game right now....  I've needed a game since this afternoon.... 
Steve: What?  
Dave: Yeah.... sorry, but I need a good game, and if you can't beat me I won't tell you where that man went!
