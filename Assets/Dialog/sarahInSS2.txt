Steve: Sarah, are you all right? 
Sarah: Yes, Steve, I am. Thank you so much. I don't know what happened here. Police are buzy. Evidently everythingâ€™s going nuts tonight!
Sarah: What about you? What you were doing out here?
Steve: I was following a man with blond hair and in green jacket. I think it is him who caused this chaos. Did you see him?
Sarah: Yes. He came in the store and talked to some customers. Then he left and went to the park.
Steve: Thanks, Sarah. Lock the door until the police come. I will be back.
