Dave: Well played, Steve.
Steve: Thanks.  Now can you tell me where is the man in green?
Dave: He left my bar a few minutes ago. But I saw him walk into the sports store just across the street.  Sorry for being so unreasonable earlier... I don't know what came over me....
Steve: Okay, thank you.
Dave: Wait. Don't be in such a hurry. Take this bottle of beer, on the house.
Steve: Thanks, but I'm on a job right now....
Dave: A lot of working people like the special.  It gives them stamina for the day!
Steve: Okay, okay. I'll have it.
