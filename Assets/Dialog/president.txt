President: And I hereby award Steve this medal, for his bravery and courage in saving us from the menace that threatened our world.  Thank you, young man.
Steve: No, thank you sir.
FBI: It’s a shame you won’t be able to tell anyone about this… but if you're interested I might be able to get you a job in the FBI somewhere. 
Steve: What would the job entail?
FBI: Well… I can’t say, but you already proved yourself more than qualified for it.  
Steve: I’m definitely interested!  Tell me more.
