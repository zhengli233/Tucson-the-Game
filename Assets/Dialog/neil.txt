Neil: Hey Steve.  I need your help.  I’ve been having a hard time with this assignment.  I haven’t been able to think straight…  Have you seen my pencil?
Steve: I know you’re a jock but this is a bit much isn’t it?
Neil: Ha ha, Steve.  Very funny, but I’m not in the mood right now.  This headache is killing me... I might lost my pencil near a PLANT upstairs...
Steve: Alright, alright, I'll find it for you.
