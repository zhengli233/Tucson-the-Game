Michael: Hey, Steve!  Can you come over here and give me a hand?  I got distracted by a weird asteroid flying by and ever since I’ve had this horrible headache….  I can’t concentrate and I can’t remember where I left my Calculator. 
Steve: You need it for this?  That’s not like you.  You’re normally so good at math.  
Michael: I know, but it feels like my head's about to split open….
Steve: Hmm…. Let me look for it for you.
